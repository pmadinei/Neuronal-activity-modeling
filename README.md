Construction of Firing-Rate Neuron and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity Models

Implementation of Network Activity, Temporal Dynamics, Winner-Take-All Inhibition, and Analyzing Long-Term Effects of Network Activity

Since firing-rate models do not include the short-time-scale dynamics that are necessary for simulating action potentials, these models are far simpler to simulate on computers. Firing-rate models also enable us to offer analytic computations of some elements of network dynamics that, in the case of spiking neurons, were unable to be addressed. These are features that include: In conclusion, spiking models often have a greater number of free parameters than firing-rate models, and it may be challenging to configure these values effectively.
